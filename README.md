# PCSC project : Implementation of numerical methods for the solution of nonlinear equations.

## Description
The aim of the project is to solve nonlinear equations. The methods considered are :
- Bissection
- Fixed Point
- Newton
- Classic Chord
  
For fixed-point methods (general fixed point and its special cases, such as the classic chord and Newton), you can decide to use an "Aitken" convergence accelerator. 

The bissection, classic chord methods only consider scalar nonlinear problem.
Newton can be applied to all kinds of non-linear equations regardless of input and output dimensions.
Fixed-Point can be applied when the input and output dimensions of the function are equal.
